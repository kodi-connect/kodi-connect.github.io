#### Amazon Developer and AWS Account
You will need to have a valid Amazon Developer, and AWS account. These are free to sign up for.

For [Amazon Developer](https://developer.amazon.com), go to their page ([developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com)), and click "Sign In". From there, you can click "Create your Amazon Developer account".

For [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com), go to their page ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)), and click "Sign Up". It will ask you for a credit card, but do not worry - AWS includes a "free tier". The service that kodi uses, AWS Lambda, will allow up to 1,000,000 requests, per month, free. You can read more here: [AWS Lambda - Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/).

**For your own safety, you are encouraged to look at [Billing](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home), and set limits/budgets, just in case. If you use other AWS Services, they may be subject to a cost.**
